#4. I am writing an application, at the moment, in it I take an input of an amount
# in the form -9.44 (9 dollars and 44 cent), the issue there may or may not be a
# minus sign, and the bank takes in the amount in cent, (944). Write a program
# called convert.py that takes in a float amount of dollars and returns that absolute amount in cent
